Fix header to allow chunks to spread over multiple frames
  - Works but not if chink starts half way through frame
  - Also very slightly buggy - frame boundry?
  - Plausible deniability via hidden volumes
  - Implement outguess and possibly F5 JPEG embedding algorithms.
  - Implement the evaluation extension task
  - Implementation of more standard encryption algorithms e.g. AES, Twofish etc.
  - Clean up code, sort out command line argument parsing properly.
